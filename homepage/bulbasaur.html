                    Bulbasaur is a small, quadrupedal amphibian Pokémon that has blue-green skin with darker patches.
                    It has red eyes with white pupils, pointed, ear-like structures on top of its head, and a short, blunt snout with a wide mouth.
                    A pair of small, pointed teeth are visible in the upper jaw when its mouth is open.
                    Each of its thick legs ends with three sharp claws.

                <p>
                    On Bulbasaur's back is a green plant bulb that conceals two slender, tentacle-like vines, which is grown from a seed planted there at birth.
                    The bulb also provides it with energy through photosynthesis as well as from the nutrient-rich seeds contained within.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is found in grasslands and forests throughout the Kanto region.
                    However, due to Bulbasaur's status as starter Pokémon, it is hard to come by in the wild and generally found under the ownership of a Trainer.

                <h3>Evolution</h3>
                <p>
                    It has been observed that a Bulbasaur's bulb will flash blue when it is ready to evolve.
                    If it does not want to evolve, it struggles to resist the transformation.
                    Many Bulbasaur gather every year in a hidden garden in Kanto to evolve into Ivysaur in a ceremony led by a Venusaur.
