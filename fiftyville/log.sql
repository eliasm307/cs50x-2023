-- Interview 1 transcript from Ruth:
--      Sometime within ten minutes of the theft, I saw the thief get into a car in the bakery parking lot and drive away.
--      If you have security footage from the bakery parking lot, you might want to look for cars that left the parking lot in that time frame.

-- Interview 2 transcript from Eugene:
--      I don't know the thief's name, but it was someone I recognized. Earlier this morning, before I arrived at Emma's bakery,
--      I was walking by the ATM on Leggett Street and saw the thief there withdrawing some money.

-- Interview 3 transcript from Raymond:
--      As the thief was leaving the bakery, they called someone who talked to them for less than a minute.
--      In the call, I heard the thief say that they were planning to take the earliest flight out of Fiftyville tomorrow.
--      The thief then asked the person on the other end of the phone to purchase the flight ticket.
